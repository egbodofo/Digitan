                        <h2>Web Design Trends</h2>
                        <p>Rapid advancements in technology have significantly impacted website design trends. Design components and features that were once considered cutting-edge have now become worn out, overused, and trite. The last thing you want when visitors land on your site is to lose potential conversions due to an outdated appearance or non-compliance with essential web standards.

                        Thankfully, our distinguished web design agency remains current with the latest website design trends, developing highly functional, user-friendly websites that perform exceptionally and boast an impressive aesthetic. We’d like to present some of the most recent breakthroughs, digital technology trends, standards, and projections for 2023.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>Captivating Scrolling</h4>
                        <p>Parallax scrolling is a widely embraced web effect that adds dynamism to specific sections of a webpage. It’s typically employed in full-width applications, accompanied by images, videos, or textured visuals that contribute depth to a page. As users scroll past the media, the scrolling action creates an illusion of the media being positioned behind adjacent sections, making the content more engaging.

                        An example can be seen below from the website: The Story of The Goonies</p>                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Website Load Time and Page Speed Are King</h4>
                        <p>One of the most critical web design standards revolves around lightning-fast load times. Prompt loading speeds have been vital components of user experience (UX) and search engine optimization (SEO) for years and continue to be a top priority for high-ranking, high-converting websites.

                        Research indicates that over half of internet users expect websites to load quickly, within two seconds of clicking a link. If your site takes longer than three seconds to load, visitors are likely to abandon it and probably never return. Website performance directly affects a company’s revenue. For instance, Pinterest managed to reduce perceived waiting times by 40%, resulting in a 15% increase in search engine traffic and user registrations.
                            
                        At Digitant, our mantra is “conversion, conversion, conversions.” We closely monitor website loading times to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>                       
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Dynamic Cursors</h4>
                        <p>A creative way to enhance your users’ experience on your website is by customizing how they interact with your web elements, including their cursors. This 2023 web design trend has charmed users with its unanticipated subtlety. By altering the cursor’s shape or introducing cursor-triggered animations, visitors can enjoy engaging with diverse scrolling behaviors or on-click actions.

                        An example can be seen on the website: Pest Stop Boys</p>                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Fonts and typography</h4>
                        <p>The general rule for selecting a font is that it should be easy-to-read and clearly visible on the background colour that you selected.The actual selection, however, should depend on your audience. Younger people, for example, often prefer more fun and stylish fonts. Older people might prefer clean and simple ones that are easier to read.

                        Your font should also reflect your brand personality and whether you want to look professional or fun and youthful. Here’s an example of a brand that does this well by their use of a creative font to reflect their own creativity.</p>                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Intelligent Content Loading Techniques</h4>
                        <p>A large number of websites today are laden with resource-intensive elements and external integrations, resulting in slower loading times. However, there are several methods available to create smarter websites that load only the necessary content for the user. Techniques such as lazy loading and infinite scrolling have been employed by major social networks for years and are particularly popular for lengthy single-page websites.

                        Adopting one or more of these technological approaches can provide a competitive edge and enhance the overall user experience, thereby improving conversion rates and search rankings. Lazy loading, for instance, ensures that web browsers like Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox download only the visible content on the screen, conserving server resources and reducing loading times for unseen content.
                            
                        Since many users never reach the bottom of a webpage, it makes more sense to load content as they scroll down, approaching the lower sections of the page.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Site navigation</h4>
                        <p>One of the biggest benefits of a good website design for your audience is that it can help them navigate the site easily. The ultimate goal of anyone visiting your website is to quickly find the information that they are looking for. And, your website design should make that process easier and help visitors navigate your website without getting lost.
                            
                        The more user-friendly your website is, the more likely it is that people will engage with your content and take the desired action. A good website design should aim to provide the best user experience, which ultimately translates into conversions.
                            
                        Airbnb, for example, has a very simple, yet engaging website design where you can find everything right from the homepage. Whether you want to make a booking or explore the different types of accommodations and experiences provided by Airbnb, you will find an option on the homepage.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>Geolocation & Browser-Based Content</h4>
                        <p>You may have noticed that the content on certain websites changes when revisited after a short period or accessed from a different device or browser. Advanced websites leverage browsing history and location data to deliver dynamic, personalized content rather than generic information intended for a broader audience.

                        Customized content for repeat visitors can result in higher conversion rates. This is evident in search engines like Google, where location-based results are displayed for queries. For instance, people searching for nearby restaurants in Raleigh, North Carolina, will see different results than users in other locations.
                            
                        An efficient directory website can also take user preferences into account, such as prioritizing Italian restaurants in search results for users who have previously reviewed or saved them. Personalized content is particularly crucial for e-commerce websites, where displaying recently viewed, saved, or liked products and highlighting abandoned cart items can lead to increased conversions.
                            
                        As users increasingly expect personalized website content, it will become a more significant factor in achieving a successful online presence.</p>                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Grid System</h4>
                        <p>In 2023, contemporary website designers are expected to favor asymmetric styles, with CSS Grid Layout gaining popularity as a powerful tool for bringing print layout capabilities to the web. This 2D grid layout system for cascading style sheets enables designers to create complex, responsive layouts while maintaining a clean and organized appearance.

                        Examples of Grids in Use: Shrine from Google’s Material Studies</p>                       
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Progressive Lead Nurturing Forms Integrated with Your CRM Tool</h4>
                        <p>Online lead generation forms are one of the most important elements of a marketing website. We want to get to know a lot about our website visitors, but we can’t ask too many questions at any particular time. We place progressive/dynamic contact forms on the landing pages and display fields according to the lead’s journey.

                        Ideally, we don’t want to display too many fields in a form, but we can always adjust the form fields according to the data that we already know about our leads. We might ask the name, company, and email address at the first conversion and then ask for the phone number, title, company size, and company revenue fields at the next conversion opportunity.
                            
                        Our CRM, like HubSpot, stores the information of our leads. By integrating it with our website. The CRM can recognize the lead when they come back to our websites and display form fields on the landing pages that we don’t know about the contact.</p>                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Chatbots More Like “Chatbuds”</h4>
                        <p>Chatbots are another feature that has been popular for a few years and will continue to be relevant in 2023. As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to get more sophisticated, we expect to see chatbots become the norm for simple customer service requests and “personal shopping.”

                        For example, if a customer visits your website, looking for phone support and the chatbot knows they have an available free phone upgrade. The chatbot can let them know about the upgrade. This can lead to a positive experience for the customer and save the business the customer support cost associated with talking to a live person.</p>                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Voice-Activated Interface</h4>
                        <p>The way we access information is changing – instead of typing into Google, we now ask a question or make a demand. This means web design is adjusting to keep up with the prevalence of voice chatbots and virtual assistants. While a voice-activated interface isn’t commonplace for most websites, this emerging trend isn’t going anywhere in the foreseeable future.

                        We can expect to see more and more websites integrating voice search as an option to traditional text search.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>Accessibility and Availability</h4>
                        <p>Inclusivity and accessibility are more than a trend, but there is a growing need for web design to factor in the needs of people with disabilities. Having a site that every visitor can navigate and interact with is more than just part of good customer service and providing an excellent experience. It can increase conversion, boost your SEO, and help you reach a bigger audience. 

                        Elements that improve accessibility include: 
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>Creating strong color contrast between text and backgrounds;</li>
                                <li>Adding focus indicators, such as the rectangular outline that shows up around links when using keyboard navigation;</li>
                                <li>Using labels and instructions with form fields rather than low-context placeholder text;</li>
                                <li>Using functional alt tags for images (which also boosts SEO!);</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                       </p>
                    </div>

                                <p>This is an excellent idea. We need to define a small number of standardized navigational dimensions and a standard way of encoding them. This would remove much of the navigation overhead from page designs.</p>
